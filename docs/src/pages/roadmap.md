# Roadmap

### Overview

[Global Illumination](https://ill.inc/), the company behind Biomes, was recently [acquired by OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/openai-acquires-global-illumination). As a result of the acquisition, the team has taken on
other responsibilities can therefore cannot support Biomes development.

Thansk to the tremendous community, support, and ethusiasm that has grown around Biomes, we would like to
keep Biomes alive and continue development through open source contributions.
[Biomes has been open sourced](https://github.com/ill-inc/biomes-game) and we are currently working to build
and recruit the required community resources.

### Supporting Biomes

Because the transition to open-source has happened so recently, we have not yet ironed out the table-stakes for
enabling willing community members to contribute to the project.

**Key items include:**

- More extensive documentation of Biomes codebase.
- Documentation of the admin tools used for development.
- Enabling seemless local developments.
- Creating open-source development workflows.
- Guidelines for contributing.
- Determining how Biomes can be hosted, independent of funding from Global Illumination.

### How can I help?

- Follow the [local development guide](/docs/basics/running-locally) and report issues that you run into
  during the process on the [Biomes GitHub](https://github.com/ill-inc/biomes-game)! Being able to run
  the game locally is instrumental in enabling open-source contributions.
- Join and support the community on the [Biomes Discord](https://discord.gg/biomes)! The strengh of any
  community comes down to it's members. _A HUGE THANKS to everyone that's already joined and
  has helped to create the community's supportive and accepting culture!_
