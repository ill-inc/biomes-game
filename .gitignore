# The external link: Differs on Windows vs macOS/Linux, so we can't check it in. The pattern needs to not have a trailing / because it's a symlink on macOS/Linux.
/external
# Bazel output symlinks: Same reasoning as /external. You need the * because people can change the name of the directory your repository is cloned into, changing the bazel-<workspace_name> symlink.
